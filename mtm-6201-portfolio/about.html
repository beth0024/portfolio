                Hi, my name is Adam and let me tell you a bit about myself before we dive deeper into some details. First and foremost, I am an ameteur interactive media designer, but I took this program as a step forward into a potential career. So far I have enjoyed most of my classes, some being a cakewalk while others were brutally hard. In the end I have constructed a multitude of finished projects that I hold close to myself; most of them being from Graphic Design because I enjoy creating visuals. Coding has never been my strongsuit, but I press forward and create what I can.

                As of writing this I am going into my 2nd year of Interactive Media Design with the addition of Co-op for a more practical experience in the workforce. My thoughts right now? I am a little nervous, but that's normal for most people considering college is a big step into choosing a path you want to take because of all the different paths that are laid bare. I've always been connected to technology, even when I was young, but that was all entertainment, not necessarily going into the technical part of technology, but I seemed to have grown some skill during this program. Did I have fun? Most of the time, but not all the time; probably because when I can't figure something out it's just a matter of what can I do to get stuff completed, and that usually ends up being half-baked projects.

                But what am I really interested in? I've always had a knack for entertainment, but not the entertainment that was explained before, no. I am talking about entertaining; being the main character and giving people something to watch. When I was younger, I would watch tons of videos to pass by the time, but it would keep me entertained. Years later I would then go and watch streams on Twitch; that's where my interest began. I have always wanted to try streaming and be the entertainer for a bunch of strangers on the internet. I don't mean to gloat, but I'd say my personality is pretty magnetic and unique. I honestly think I would make a good entertainer, and to top that off, I am pretty good at a handful of games.
