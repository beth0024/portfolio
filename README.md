# When I was working on this project, I found that structuring the HTML files were fairly simple excluding the image resizing. The real difficult part I had was on the CSS. When I was coding, nothing seemed to work most of the time and because of the sheer amount of HTML code there was, the amount of CSS would be far more due to formatting. Getting blocks to where they need to be was harder than I anticipated considering moving things around the page can be a gamble because of screen sizes; you don't want something to go off the page.
# After further CSS coding and optimizing HTML formatting, centering text and images wasn't so bad after all. Some issues sprung up being the text going over images on the home page, so I left it as is. Time became a problem and the tablet and desktop screens would be a lot harder than mobile because of more unique structuring. With how my progress went during this time, I was pretty happy with what I accomplished despite it being miniscule to the size of the entire project. If I had known about some coding issues sooner, more would've been done, but so far this is what the previous project was around.
